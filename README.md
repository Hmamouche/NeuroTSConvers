# Introduction
This repository represent a system of brain activity prediction using behavioral features.
The brain activity is measures throud the BOLD signal, and the behavioral features represent verbal and non-verbal variables extracted during an experience of several human-human and human-robot conversations.

The aim is to detect the behavioral features that are responsible for the activation of each brain area, by means of prediction.
A feature selection step is performed to select the input variables for the prediction of brain activity, then the most relevant imput features are those how leads to the best prediction score.

# The experience

# Extracting time series from video files
* Using OpenFace to extract the following features:
  * Facial Action Units
  * Landmarks
  * Head Pose Estimation

# Extracting time series from audio files

# Extracting time series from eyetracking data
